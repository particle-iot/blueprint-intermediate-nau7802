  This blueprint demonstrates how to integrate a NAU7802-based QWIIC scale breakout with a load cell to measure weight on your Particle device.

  Key features:
  - Uses the SparkFun NAU7802 Arduino library as a 3rd party dependency
  - Implements cloud functions for tare and calibration
  - Stores calibration values in EEPROM for persistence across reboots
  - Outputs weight readings via serial monitor
